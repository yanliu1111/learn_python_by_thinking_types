# Learn Python from Thinking Types

This repository is designed to provide a quick review of Python basics. The accompanying YouTube channel introduces a new teaching structure that follows a data type-centric approach.

PS: After python 3.6, the type hints are not required. They are just a way to make the code more readable. The type hints are not enforced by the python interpreter. So, if you are using python 3.6 or above, you can skip the type hints. -- I know, I know, I am a bit late to the party.¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

I built two projects and overthought they look simple, they are densely packed with all above concepts.

1. Cash Register
2. SuperHero Game
